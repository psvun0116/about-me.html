        <h3>Every weekday I wake up around 5:30am to get ready to go to work. I travel about 20 minutes to work in Auburn. I work about 8 hours a day. Then I drive about 20 minutes to about an hour back home.</h3>

        <h3>On Mondays and Tuesdays, I go to school at Epicodus to learn how to program. Every time I am in class, I learn new things. Currently we are learing about div and span.</h3>

        <h3>Weekends are me time. I like to be <span class="highlight">outdoors</span>. Mainly go <span class="outdoor-type">hiking and site seeing</span>. I love being in the <span class="outdoor-type">woods and finding new places to explore</span>. Sometimes, I like to skateboard.</h3>
